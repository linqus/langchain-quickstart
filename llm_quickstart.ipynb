Expectations-augmented Phillips Curve: This theory builds on the original Phillips Curve by adding the element of inflation expectations. It suggests that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is not fixed, but is influenced by people's expectations of future inflation. When people expect higher inflation, they will demand higher wages, leading to an increase in inflation.\\n\\n3. Natural Rate of Unemployment: This theory argues that there is a natural rate of unemployment in the economy, also known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). This is the level of unemployment at which inflation is stable and not affected by changes in unemployment. Any deviation from this natural rate will result in either higher or lower inflation.\\n\\n4.
